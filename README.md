# OrderService - simplified sketch of an online store

The project includes simple functions intended for store owners (e.g. adding products, managing orders) as well as for its users (e.g. placing an order).

### Main functions for store owners:
- adding new product;
- updating inventory levels;
- changing order statuses;
- checking order statuses;

### Main functions for users:
- placing order;
- checking order status;

:rocket: *In the future, it is planned to expand the application, and as it grows, the directory structure, the database used and the use of Docker will change*
